# Provisioning AWS resources using Terraform & Ansible

I would like to you the way to provisioning some resources using Terraform and Ansible together on AWS Cloud.

## Setup AWS credentials

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```
